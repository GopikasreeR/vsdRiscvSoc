# 🚀 VSD-SoC-Labs: RISC-V SoC Design and Development

This is the official repository for the **VSD-SoC-Labs** initiative — a **34-week immersive journey** into the design and development of a **RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC)**.  
This project is supported by **MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, India)** and **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.Each week focuses on a new concept in the RISC-V SoC flow.

## 🌟 Overview

This long-term project is designed to guide students, engineers, and VLSI enthusiasts through the **end-to-end SoC development pipeline**, covering:

- ✅ RISC-V ISA mastery
- 🔧 Bare-metal embedded programming
- 💡 RTL design using Verilog
- ✔️ Functional & formal verification
- 🧪 Synthesis, place-and-route
- 🧠 SoC integration with peripherals
- 🧱 Layout and GDS generation
- 🧾 Silicon tapeout preparation

We target the **RV32IMAC** ISA, and all tasks are completed using **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**, along with open-source tools like:

- 🧰 **QEMU** – Bare-metal simulation
- 🔍 **Verilator** – RTL simulation
- ⚙️ **Qflow/OpenLane** – Digital synthesis and layout
- 🖥️ **VSDSquadron Board** – Real hardware deployment
